# Homework
In the source code you'll find three features that are marked as `TODO`.

1. Populate the color dropdown with values from the `ChatApp` object. So users can select a color to chat with.
1. There is a bug that when a user clicks on one of his/her own messages to edit it, the message input stays in `EDIT` mode after updating.
1. The feature to automatically mute a user that sends too many messages too quickly has not been finished. Please finish implementing this feature.
